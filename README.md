## Detecting associations between oxidative stress and telomere length at different levels of oxidative stress repeatability

This repository contains the R code used in simulations to investigate how oxidative stress repeatability affects the ability to detect an association between oxidative stress and telomere length 

Specifically, the code explores how varying OS repeatability, sample sizes, and repeated measures influences the statistical power to detect a causal oxidative stress and telomere length relationship
